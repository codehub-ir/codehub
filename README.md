# CodeHub
codehub is a platform for archiving the errors, bugs, and scripts you intend to share with others. You may have seen the other samples anywhere but this platform is completely Persian, free and also accessible to all friends.
Not only can you share your programming problems in codehub, but you can also easily write handy scripts and modules and send them to your friends on social networks.

# Platforms
I used Django version 3 for the first version of the backend part, and Bootstrap version 4 for the front one.
Django is a web framework written in Python that has always been at the forefront of security and power.

Bootstrap is a fully responsive CSS framework that gives you a lot of features. You can easily build your own templates with this popular framework in a second. Honestly, my reason for using this framework is its simplicity and functionality.

# Development
Along with the HTTP codehub service, I was also thinking of developer friends, and I designed the API service so that programmer friends could easily develop and use codehub on various platforms.

If you are interested in this and have a hub-like environment on your favorite platforms and have no knowledge of APIs, I suggest you watch a few videos of the RESTful API and see examples of its applications in different environments.
Not hard at all! Just have a little interest and read the next part carefully. Then you can be a developer too.

# API
More commonly, APIs are a set of defined and transparent ways to communicate between different software components. A good API makes it easier to develop a computer software by providing the necessary building blocks. An API can be designed for a web system, operating system, database system, computer hardware, or software library.
